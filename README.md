The first version of this app was made with the objective of working with UITableView. The app was later modified to use Core Data for persistence. EveryDo can assign specific tasks to users, and add multiple users as needed. Delete a user and all the tasks assigned to them are removedâ€”but delete a task, and only that task is deleted.
